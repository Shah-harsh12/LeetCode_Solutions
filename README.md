# 🧠 LeetCode Solutions – Pattern-Based Interview Prep

This repository contains my structured solutions to LeetCode problems, written while preparing for SDE-level technical interviews.

The goal is not just to solve problems — but to understand patterns, optimize approaches, and write clean, interview-ready code.

## 🎯 Approach Philosophy

For most problems, I try to:

1. Start with brute-force intuition
2. Improve time complexity
3. Write optimal solution
4. Handle edge cases
5. Explain reasoning clearly

Where applicable, I compare:
- O(n²) vs O(n)
- O(n + m) vs O(log(min(n,m)))
- Brute vs optimized

## ⏱ Complexity Awareness

Each solution focuses on:
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
- Interview trade-offs
- Why the optimized version works

---

## 🧩 Problem-Solving Patterns

This repository emphasizes recognizing patterns:

- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Fast & Slow Pointers
- Binary Search
- Divide & Conquer
- KMP (LPS Array)
- Heap (Min / Max Priority Queue)
- In-place Linked List Manipulation

---

## 🧪 Code Style

- Clean and readable
- Interview-friendly
- Minimal but clear variable naming
- Edge-case handling
- Optimized pointer manipulation

---

## 📈 Goal

To consistently practice and improve algorithmic thinking while preparing for SDE interviews at top tech companies.

This repository will be continuously updated with new problems and optimized approaches.
